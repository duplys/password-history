In contrast to earlier mainframe computers, time sharing allowed to simultaneously share computing resources among many users. Because users now had their private files, passwords were introduced as a simple mechanism for user authentication.

It also contains the story of the first (known) password theft performed by then MIT's PhD researcher Allan Scherr who, in the spring of 1962, printed out the password file to get more usage time on CTSS for the performance simulations he needed to run for his PhD thesis.
